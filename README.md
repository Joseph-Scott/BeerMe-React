BeerMe


Description:

Welcome to BeerMe! We've created a wep application that allows you to search for craft beer
breweries in the Atlanta area, as well as the specific popular beers that they brew. Using 
an API created from the treasure trove of craft beer information on BeerAdvocate, our app 
brings the world of craft beer to your fingertips with a versatile search module 
to find that one great brewery you're looking. Enjoy!

3. From the search page, users can use the interactive Google map to see the names and
locations of different breweries by hovering over each pin on the map. Users can also 
enter search criteria into the search bar (ex: IPA), which will then bring up a list 
of beers relevant to your search and will add pins to the map showing the locations of 
the breweries where the beer you're looking for can be found.
