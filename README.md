BeerMe


Description:

Welcome to BeerMe! We've created a wep application that allows you to search for craft beer
breweries worldwide, as well as the specific popular beers that they brew. Using 
an API created from the treasure trove of craft beer information on Untappd, our app 
brings the world of craft beer to your fingertips with a versatile search module 
to find that one great brewery you're looking. Enjoy!
