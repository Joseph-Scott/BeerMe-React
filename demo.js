Sound like your ideal mother-in-law? Fair enough, but it also is a pretty dead-on description of our Scotch Ale. In a difficult hop-growing climate, Scottish brewers relied on other ingredients to impart flavor and bitterness – one such ingredient was smoked malt. Drafty Kilt is a dark, malty bombshell of a beer.",

                    "This juicy IPA was developed in our “underground” basement brewery. Shh…don’t ask about what was happening in the basement, but the beer flows out of the tap a deep persimmon with fluffy khaki foam. The only dank aroma emanating from this basement is one of earthy tones, juicy citrus and a hint of lemongrass all derived from Citra hops. Basement IPA is balanced with a nice malty body that creates a sweet finish and developed hop notes in every sip. There is a hint of alcohol heat on the way down for this hop forward Northeast style IPA. Beer geeks rejoice but you have to leave your parent’s basement because for now Basement IPA is only at your local establishment.",

Therefore, to make one that will not only thrive in this competitive market but also set itself apart, we had to really deconstruct the IPA in its current form in order to build a better one. We have done this with The "A". Huge hop aromas and flavors of tropical fruits, bright citrus, and spicy pine meld with a very clean profile and firm bitter finish to deliver an "A" class IPA experience. This Eventide Spring seasonal is everything you want in an IPA and more. Welcome to The “A”.',

                    'One of four initial releases from the New Realm Hop Audition Series, this IPA stars Sterling hops. This American hop was bred as a replacement for Czech Saaz, a legendary hop varietal found in many classic European beers. Sterling shines in this IPA, creating a profile including herbal, grassy, spicy & dank notes.\r\n\r\nSterling, along with its 3 "tap-mates" (Hop Audition Series: Citra, Vic Secret & Wakatu) are all cut from the same mash. Each beer is identical up until their dry-hop, which is where each starring hop is called in for audition. Try all 4 to taste the difference & nuance.\r\n\r\nOur Hop Audition Series is an expanding collection of experimental brews where our brewers test out our favorite hops, new hops or experimental varieties.',

This unique style combines the bold flavor of an English Porter and richness of a Russian Imperial Stout. It is the only porter that is a lager, as cold fermentation was necessary to preserve it during the long voyage across the Baltic Sea. This strong style boasts a roasty, caramel profile accompanied by mild chocolate undertones. It pairs very well with powerful meats, particularly game, and other hearty Nordic cuisines.",
